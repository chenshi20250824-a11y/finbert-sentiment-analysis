##  Project Overview

This project is a **real-time financial news sentiment analysis system** based on the **FinBERT** pre-trained model. It automatically analyzes the impact of financial news on stock prices and predicts stock price movement trends.And based on the fact that FINBERT can only generate positive, negative, or neutral outputs, we match our news with stock prices, allowing it to roughly predict stock price trends and categorize them into seven types, providing better investment advice.

### Core Features

-  **7-Class Prediction**: Fine-grained classification into 7 categories
-  **Web Interface**: Beautiful and user-friendly web UI
-  **Real-time Prediction**: Instant analysis results
-  **Investment Advice**: Provides actionable insights based on predictions

##  Features

###  7-Class Classification System

| Category | Chinese Name | Price Change | Description |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **crash** | 大跌 | < -5% | Major negative news |
| **drop** | 中跌 | -5% ~ -2% | Significant bearish news |
| **small_drop** | 小跌 | -2% ~ -1% | Minor bearish news |
| **stable** | 震荡 | -1% ~ 1% | Neutral news |
| **small_rise** | 小涨 | 1% ~ 2% | Minor bullish news |
| **rise** | 中涨 | 2% ~ 5% | Significant bullish news |
| **surge** | 大涨 | > 5% | Major positive news |

##  FAQ

### Q1: Why are predictions sometimes inaccurate?

**A:** Possible reasons:
- News text is too short or lacks information
- News content is outside the model's training scope
- The dataset is too small
- The website's anti-scraping measures have been strengthened, making it difficult to find data.

### Q2: Can it analyze Chinese news?

**A:** Currently, the model only supports English news. For Chinese news: 
1. Use translation API to convert to English
2. Or retrain with Chinese financial model (e.g., FinBERT-Chinese)

### Q3: How to improve prediction accuracy?

**A:** Improvement directions:
- Increase training data volume
- Use larger models (e.g., FinBERT-large)
- Integrate multiple features (technical indicators, market sentiment, etc.)
- Use ensemble learning methods (GARCH-X Model,Regression model,Vector Autoregression,Volatility Measurement)

### Q4: Website cannot be accessed?

**A:** Checklist:
- [ ] Confirm server is running
- [ ] Check if port 5000 is occupied
- [ ] Check firewall settings
- [ ] Clear browser cache

### Q5: Can the model be used for actual trading?

**A:**  **Not recommended! **
- This project is for educational and research purposes only
- Predictions are for reference only
- Investment involves risks; decisions should be made cautiously
- Combine with fundamental and technical analysis

##  Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

#### 1. Time Window Selection

- **Current Approach**: Using same-day stock price changes as labels
- **Issue**: When predicting newly published news, stock prices may not have fully reacted yet
- **Impact**:  Potential inconsistency between training and application scenarios

#### 2. Data Timeliness

- Changes in market conditions may affect model performance

#### 3. Language Constraints
- Other languages (e.g., Chinese) require retraining

### Improvement Roadmap

#### Short-term Improvements (1-3 months)

- [ ] Implement multi-time-window prediction (T+0, T+1, T+2)
- [ ] Compare effectiveness of different time windows
- [ ] Dynamically adjust prediction strategy based on news publication time

#### Mid-term Improvements (3-6 months)

- [ ] Increase training data volume to 50,000+ articles
- [ ] Support Chinese news analysis
- [ ] Integrate multi-dimensional features (technical indicators, market sentiment, etc.)

#### Long-term Vision (6-12 months)

- [ ] Real-time news stream processing
- [ ] Multi-stock correlation analysis
- [ ] Reinforcement learning for trading strategy optimization

---

##  Future Improvements

### Feature Extensions

- [ ] Support Chinese news analysis
- [ ] Add historical prediction records
- [ ] Export analysis reports (PDF)
- [ ] Integrate real-time news crawler
- [ ] Support batch analysis

### Model Optimization

- [ ] Use larger models (FinBERT-large)
- [ ] Multi-task learning (sentiment + entity recognition)
- [ ] Integrate multi-modal data (text + numerical)
- [ ] Time series modeling
- [ ] Reinforcement learning optimization

### Engineering Improvements

- [ ] Deploy to cloud servers
- [ ] Containerized deployment (Docker)
- [ ] CI/CD automation
